# SECURITY

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please send bug report to security@gonative.cc with the issue details, reproduction, impact, and other information. Please submit only one unique email thread per vulnerability. Any issues reported via email are ineligible for bounty rewards. Please note: our team is not able to monitor dynamic content (e.g. a Google Docs link that is edited after receipt) throughout the lifecycle of a report. If you would like to share additional information or modify previous information, please include it in an additional reply as an additional attachment.

We are happy to reward a bug bounty.

## IMPORTANT

Please DO NOT file a public issue in this repository to report a security vulnerability.
